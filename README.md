# Women's Intimates Modeling Project
This project - currently in phase one - utilizes nine data sets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/innerwear-data-from-victorias-secret-and-others/). The datasets come from different brands/retailers of women's intimates; each observation is a product with both suggested retail price and current price at the point in time the data was pulled.

The goal of the project is to create a machine learning algorithm to predict current price. The resulting model in phase one was a simple linear regression with a mean absolute error of $4.

Next steps for this project are to reincorporate the two datasets I was unable to include for phase one (see notes in notebook), further break down my created parent_category metric to make prediction more accurate, and to explore other models once I've further improved and vetted the features to be used.
